mvt 1:
- get rid of cresc decresc m13
- m17 : don't know how in musescore, you can do what is in the score (with double bar in the middle of a measure)
  2 possibilities : * get rid of the double bar
                    * divide the measure in 2 a 3/4 and a 1/4
  1st option is preferable because of measure consistency (we want the same number of measure as in the score)
- m19 : some "_" that I can't remove... (edit of the mxl file ?)
- m29 : last stem on Cello is not right
- m82 : couldn't place the "al" at the right place
- m93 : problem of time signature (switch to 2/2
- m171 : did not write "sempre" of "pp sempre"
- m283 : cresc. on cello on downbeat instead of third beat
